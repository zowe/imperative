/**
 * Default Credential Manager is our implementation of the Imperative Credential Manager. This manager invokes methods
 * created by the keytar utility (https://www.npmjs.com/package/keytar) to access the secure credential vault on the
 * user's machine.
 *
 * ### Keychains Used by Keytar
 *
 * | OS | Vault |
 * |----|----------|
 * | Windows | Credential Vault |
 * | macOS | Keychain |
 * | Linux | Secret Sevice API/libsecret |
 *
 * ### Optional Install of Keytar
 *
 * It should be noted that keytar is an optional dependency of Imperative. This is because on Linux, it will not work
 * out of the box without some additional configuration to install libsecret. Keytar provides the following
 * documentation for Linux users to install libsecret:
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Depending on your distribution, you will need to run the following command:
 *
 * - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`
 * - Red Hat-based: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`
 * - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`
